== Intro ==
This is a hack for phpRaider's phpBB3 auth plugin. It validates that the user
is in a specific group when handling authentication.

== Setup ==
1. Drop the file in PHPRAIDER_ROOT/authentication/phpbb3. 

2. Change the hardcoded group ID (look for the $AUTH_GROUP_ID variable) to whatever
   it ought be.

3. Shit works. If you remove the user from the phpBB group, their access to phpRaider
   is disabled.

== TODO ==
* Make the group ID a config option instead of a hardcoded value. (like I fucking care)
